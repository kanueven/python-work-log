# Dice Rolling Game

🔗 GitHub Repo: https://github.com/kanueven/mitprojects.git

## Description
- A Python program that simulates rolling dice.
- User can roll a specified number of dice and see the results.
- Tracks how many times dice have been rolled in a session.
- Based on Programming by Mosh's "Python Projects for Beginners" course.

## Completed Tasks
- Implemented infinite loop to repeatedly roll dice until user exits
- Allowed user to specify how many dice to roll
- Added input validation to ensure number of dice is positive integer
- Added a counter to track total rolls per session
- Displayed results of each roll in a list format

## Challenges / Bugs
- Learned to handle invalid inputs with `try/except`
- Ensured the program didn’t break when the user entered zero or negative numbers
- Learned how to properly increment and display a roll counter

## Next Steps
- Add optional enhancements like:
  - Summing the total of dice rolled
  - Displaying graphical dice using ASCII art
  - Logging session results to a file
- Refactor code into functions for better modularity
- Practice unit testing with `pytest` for dice outcomes

## Notes
- Practiced list comprehensions for rolling multiple dice
- Learned importance of error handling for robust CLI programs
